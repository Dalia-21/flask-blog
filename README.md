# Flask Blog
Blog to practice Python and Flask coding

I started this blog to practice Python development and to give myself a platform to express some thoughts on software development. Since then other commitments have taken up a lot of my time. This blog needs significant work to clean up the code and give it a more useable and well thought out interface. I also need to write a more comprehensive Readme. I will be doing all this at some point if I get the time, but for now the codebase still serves as a good example of how to integrate plugins such as flask-admin into a small web application.
